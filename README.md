"A simple, secure website to help you remember your meds and keep your health info organized."

🤔 The Problem
Let's be real: it’s hard to remember to take medication on time. Doctors say "simple forgetfulness" is the #1 reason treatment fails. Plus, we often lose physical prescriptions or forget the verbal advice doctors give us about diet and exercise.

💡 Our Solution
MedCare is your **Digital Pillbox**. It reminds you when to take your pills (e.g., "After Breakfast") and gives you a safe place to store your medical history and reports.
